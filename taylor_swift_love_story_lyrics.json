{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Love Story par Taylor Swift\r\nWe were both young when I first saw you\nI close my eyes and the flashback starts\nI'm standing there\nOn a balcony in summer air\nSee the lights, see the party, the ball gowns\nSee you make your way through the crowd\nAnd say, \"Hello\"\nLittle did I know\n\nThat you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\nAnd I was crying on the staircase\nBegging you, \"Please don't go,\" and I said\n\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\n\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story, baby, just say \"Yes\"\n\nSo I sneak out to the garden to see you\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\nSo close your eyes\nEscape this town for a little while, oh, oh\n\n'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet\"\nBut you were everything to me\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go,\" and I said\n\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nI'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\nYou'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\nIt's a love story baby just say \"Yes\"\nRomeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel\n\nThis love is difficult, but it's real\nDon't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess\nIt's a love story, baby, just say \"Yes\"\n\nOh, oh\n\nAnd I got tired of waiting\nWondering if you were ever coming around\nMy faith in you was fading\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\n\nAnd I said, \"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\n\nI love you and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"}
