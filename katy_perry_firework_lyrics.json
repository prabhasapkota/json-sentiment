{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Firework par Katy Perry\r\nDo you ever feel like a plastic bag\nDrifting through the wind, wanting to start again?\nDo you ever feel, feel so paper thin\nLike a house of cards, one blow from caving in?\n\nDo you ever feel already buried deep?\nSix feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing\nDo you know that there's still a chance for you\n'Cause there's a spark in you?\n\nYou just gotta ignite the light and let it shine\nJust own the night like the 4th of July\n\n'Cause baby, you're a firework\n\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, oh\nAs you shoot across the sky\n\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, oh\nYou're gonna leave 'em falling down\n\nYou don't have to feel like a waste of space\nYou're original, cannot be replaced\nIf you only knew what the future holds\nAfter a hurricane comes a rainbow\n\nMaybe you're reason why all the doors are closed\nSo you could open one that leads you to the perfect road\nLike a lightning bolt, your heart will blow\n\nAnd when it's time, you'll know\n\nYou just gotta ignite the light and let it shine\nJust own the night like the 4th of July\n\n'Cause baby you're a firework\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, oh\nAs you shoot across the sky\n\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, oh\nYou're gonna leave 'em falling down\n\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon\nIt's always been inside of you, you, you\n\nAnd now it's time to let it through\n\n'Cause baby you're a firework\nCome on, show 'em what you're worth\nMake 'em go, oh\nAs you shoot across the sky\n\nBaby, you're a firework\nCome on, let your colors burst\nMake 'em go, oh\nYou're gonna leave 'em falling down\n\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon\nBoom, boom, boom\nEven brighter than the moon, moon, moon"}
